Standard deviation: It is the measurement of the dispersion away from the mean.

The more spread the data is, the higher the standard deviation.

Volatile stocks have high standard deviation and therefore standard deviation represents
the risks that is associated with security.


Standard Deviation  σ= √((∑_(i=1)^n(x-x ̅ )^2 )/(n-1))
Where,
x = Value at index i
x ̅ = mean value
n = total number of datapoints in dataset.

Sharp ratio: It is used by investers to calculate the return of an investment compared to its risk

Sharp ratio is calculated as follows:

Sharp ratio = (Rp – Rf)/σp 

Where,
Rp = return of the security
Rf  = risk free return
σp = Standard deviation

Sharp ratio is  a simple calculation of the average return earned in excess of the risk free 
rate(Govt Bonds) per unit of risk.

Here Rf is risk free rate of return which is the return on an investment with zero risk, i.e it’s 
return investors could except for taking no risks.

As Sharp ratio increases, risk adjusted return increases and security becomes more desired by investors.
