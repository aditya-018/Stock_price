# Stock Price and Asset Allocation
This contains all the information that you need for asset allocation and portfolio daily return.
Based on the stocks that you have and the amount that you invest.
And the risk you are willing to take
A portfolio is a collection of financial investments such as stocks, fixed income securities i.e bonds and 
also cash, mutual funds and Exchange traded funds.

Asset allocation is an investment strategy that is used to allocate clientâ€™s assets based on their risks 
tolerance, target returns and investnment time spans.

The goal of a portfolio manager is to reduce risks and increase income/returns.
There are many asset classes:
->Equities(Stocks)
->Fixed Income securities(Bonds)
->Cash and equivalents
->Exchange Traded funds 
->Real Estate
->Commodities.

The conventional wisdom is to subtract the age of the client to calculate the % of portfolio that should 
be allocated to the stocks.

For-ex: If the age of a client is 30yrs, then he/she would be having a 70% allocation in your stocks.

The rate of risk is higher associated with high returns.
